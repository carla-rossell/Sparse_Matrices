# Sparse_Matrices
Create sparse matrices for every FOV in the scan
The main script is 'create_sparse.py' which has to be stored in the same directory as the .h5 files and the .tif files.

The other script 'create_sparse_v2.py' is the modification of the original script but turning the FOV arrays into lists.
